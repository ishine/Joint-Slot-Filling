# RNN-for-Joint-NLU

Pytorch implementation of "Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network Models for Joint Intent Detection and Slot Filling" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01454.pdf)

Intent prediction and slot filling are performed in two branches based on Encoder-Decoder model.

## Environment 
`PyTorch >= 0.4.0`
